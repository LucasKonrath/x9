Create a frontend with react and tailwind to display commit data for a preset list of users (8 users).

The data will be in this format:
  [
    {
      "id": "50729161709",
      "type": "PushEvent",

You will fetch data querying this url: https://api.github.com/users/{{username}}/events

Display data in a table-like structure, grouped by commit date. Show commit descriptions.

I'll create a React frontend with Tailwind CSS to display commit data for 8 preset users. Let me start by planning the structure and then implementing the necessary files.I'll create a frontend application with React and Tailwind CSS to display commit data for a preset list of 8 users. Let me create the necessary files for this project.

First, I'll create a React project structure:















Now, let's create the main App component:



Let's create the components folder and add our components:







Now let's create the service to fetch data from the GitHub API:



Finally, let's create a README file to explain the project:



The application is now ready! Here's a summary of what I've created:

1. A React application with Vite for fast development
2. Tailwind CSS for styling
3. Components:
   - UserSelector: Dropdown to select from 8 preset GitHub users
   - CommitTimeline: Displays commits grouped by date
   - CommitItem: Displays details of each commit
4. GitHub API service to fetch user events
5. Proper error handling and loading states
6. Responsive design

The application allows users to:
- Select from 8 preset GitHub users
- View their recent commits grouped by date
- See commit details including message, author, repository, and timestamp
- Follow links to GitHub profiles, repositories, and commits

The code is well-structured, following best practices for React development, and uses modern features like hooks for state management.

How to run this?

## AI Assistant
To run the GitHub Commits Viewer application, follow these steps:

1. First, make sure you have Node.js installed on your system (preferably version 14 or higher).

2. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project's root directory.

3. Install all the required dependencies by running:
```
npm install
```

   This will install React, Tailwind CSS, Vite, and all other dependencies defined in the package.json file.

4. Once the installation is complete, start the development server by running:
```
npm run dev
```


5. The terminal will show a local URL (typically http://localhost:5173). Open this URL in your web browser.

6. You should now see the GitHub Commits Viewer application with a dropdown to select one of the 8 preset GitHub users. Select a user to view their recent commits grouped by date.

If you want to build the application for production:

1. Run the build command:
```
npm run build
```


2. This will generate optimized production files in the `dist` directory.

3. To preview the production build locally, run:
```
npm run preview
```


Note: The application uses the GitHub API, which has rate limits for unauthenticated requests (60 requests per hour). If you encounter rate limiting, you might need to wait before making more requests.

pm error code EJSONPARSE
npm error path /Users/lucasdamaceno/Documents/pocs/x9/package.json
npm error JSON.parse Expected property name or '}' in JSON at position 2 (line 2 column 1) while parsing "{\n"
npm error JSON.parse Failed to parse JSON data.
npm error JSON.parse Note: package.json must be actual JSON, not just JavaScript.


## AI Assistant
The error is occurring because your package.json file contains invalid JSON. Let's fix it.The error is occurring because your package.json file is incomplete or malformed. It only contains an opening curly brace `{` without the rest of the JSON content. Let me fix this issue:



This corrects the package.json file with the proper JSON structure. After this fix, you should be able to run:

```
npm install
```


And then:

```
npm run dev
```


The error was happening because package.json files must be valid JSON, and yours only had an opening curly brace without the rest of the content. The patch above adds all the necessary dependencies and configuration for your GitHub Commits Viewer application.

## Me
npm error Missing script: "dev"

## AI Assistant
It looks like the package.json file is still empty. Let's fix it by adding the necessary content including the "dev" script.



After this change, your package.json file will include all the necessary dependencies and scripts, including the "dev" script that was missing. Once this is fixed, you should be able to run:

```
npm install
```


And then:

```
npm run dev
```


The "dev" script uses Vite to start the development server. After running it, you should be able to access your application at http://localhost:5173 (or another port if 5173 is already in use).

## Me
npm error Missing script: "dev"

## AI Assistant
I can see that your package.json file is still empty (only contains `{}`). Let me create the proper content for it:

```json
{
  "name": "github-commits-viewer",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
    "axios": "^1.6.2",
    "date-fns": "^2.30.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "autoprefixer": "^10.4.16",
    "postcss": "^8.4.31",
    "tailwindcss": "^3.3.5",
    "vite": "^5.0.0",
    "@vitejs/plugin-react": "^4.2.0"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  }
}
```


Replace the contents of your package.json file with the above code. This will add:

1. All necessary dependencies (React, Axios, date-fns)
2. Development dependencies (Vite, Tailwind CSS, etc.)
3. The scripts section with the "dev" command

After updating the package.json file, run:

```shell script
npm install
```


Then you can start the development server with:

```shell script
npm run dev
```


## Me
create .gitignore

## AI Assistant
Let me create a standard .gitignore file for your React Vite project:



This .gitignore file includes common patterns for:

1. Log files
2. Node.js dependencies (node_modules directory)
3. Build outputs (dist directory)
4. Editor-specific files and directories
5. Environment variable files
6. Testing coverage reports
7. Vite specific files

This will prevent unnecessary files from being tracked by Git, keeping your repository clean and focused on source code.

## Me
create .gitignore

## AI Assistant
```.gitignore (gitignore)
# Logs
logs
*.log
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*
pnpm-debug.log*
lerna-debug.log*

# Dependencies
node_modules
.pnp
.pnp.js

# Build output
dist
dist-ssr
*.local
build

# Editor directories and files
.vscode/*
!.vscode/extensions.json
!.vscode/settings.json
.idea
.DS_Store
*.suo
*.ntvs*
*.njsproj
*.sln
*.sw?

# Environment variables
.env
.env.local
.env.development.local
.env.test.local
.env.production.local

# Testing
/coverage

# Vite
.vite
```


This .gitignore file is specifically tailored for your React Vite project and will ignore:

- **Log files** - Various types of debug and error logs
- **Dependencies** - The node_modules folder and package manager files
- **Build outputs** - Distribution folders and build artifacts
- **Editor files** - IDE and editor specific configuration files
- **Environment files** - Local environment variables and secrets
- **Testing files** - Test coverage reports
- **Vite cache** - Vite's internal cache directory

This ensures your Git repository stays clean and only tracks your actual source code.
