# Public Directory

This directory contains markdown files for users.

Each user should have their own subdirectory named after their username.

For example:

- `/public/LucasKonrath/2025-06-10.md`
- `/public/xmacedo/2025-06-13.md`

Make sure these directories exist for the application to work properly.
